The source files in this directory can be used to compile 'easytest' (a program
that annotates a batch of ECG records) and 'bxbep' (a program that derives
performance statistics from the output of 'easytest', based on 'bxb' from the
WFDB Software Package; note that 'bxbep' has been renamed to avoid confusion
with the original 'bxb').

These source files are based on those contained in osea20.zip, with minor
modifications needed to compile them using gcc.  They have been tested under
GNU/Linux and under MS-Windows with Cygwin; they should work on any other
platform for which gcc is available, including Mac OS/X (Darwin) and other
versions of Unix.

To compile these sources and run the programs:

1. Install gcc if you have not already done so.  Under MS-Windows, install
   the Cygwin software package available freely from http://www.cygwin.com/.
   Under Mac OS/X, install the Mac OS/X Developer Tools, available freely from
   http://developer.apple.com/macosx/.

2. Download the sources for the WFDB Software Package, available freely from
   http://www.physionet.org/physiotools/wfdb.shtml.  Follow the instructions
   there to compile and install the WFDB software using gcc.

3. Unpack the osea 2.0 software by typing:
	tar xfvz osea20-gcc.tar.gz
   This creates a directory called osea20-gcc, containing the sources for
   'easytest' and 'bxbep'.  Enter this directory by typing:
	cd osea20-gcc

4. The sources are set up by default so that easytest and bxbep will
   read the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database files directly from PhysioNet
   (you don't need to have local copies of these files).  If you do
   have local copies, be sure that they are in the current directory.

   If you want to run 'easytest' and 'bxbep' on a different set of
   records, edit 'inputs.h' to comment out the definition of PHYSIOBANK
   near the beginning, and define either MITDB or AHADB as you wish.
   You can also define your own set of records following the same model.
   You will need to recompile (next step) before any changes you make
   in 'inputs.h' are effective.

5. Compile the sources by typing:
	make
   There should be no compilation errors or warnings.

   The file named 'Makefile' controls what happens when you run
   these 'make' commands.  'Makefile' is a text file that you can
   edit if necessary.

6. Run the osea 2.0 software by typing:
	./easytest             [or './easytest2']
	./bxbep
   There should be no run-time errors or warnings.

   'easytest2' is a version of 'easytest' that includes 'qrsdet2' rather
   than the original 'qrsdet'.  It is otherwise identical to 'easytest'.

   Note that 'easytest' (or 'easytest2') may take a long time to run if
   it is reading data directly from PhysioNet and if your connection to
   the PhysioNet master server at MIT is slow.

   The output of 'easytest' is a set of annotation files with the suffix
   (annotator name) 'atest', one for each record processed.

   The output of 'bxbep' is a pair of files (adtstat.txt and testrpt.txt)
   that are described in the osea documentation available from EP Limited.

   All of the output files are written to the current directory.
